      "The father was acting as a surety for the debt of the son, and the car lot was the obligee. Generally, the surety is released from liability if the obligee modifies the contract with the principal without obtaining the surety's consent, or if the obligee fails to perfect its interest in collateral given by the principal. In addition, a surety may be released from liability if the obligee fails to bring suit to enforce the debt against the principal within a reasonable time after default. However, none of these general rules will apply if the surety agrees that the obligee may resort to the surety for payment only after proceeding against the principal. The father's promise to the finance manager that the car lot could look to the father for payment in the event of a default by the son falls within this exception. Therefore, the car lot may hold the father liable for the debt, even without first bringing suit against the son. Answers 1 and 3 are incorrect because the father did agree to be a surety, and there is no rule that parents are responsible for the debts of their children. Answer 0 is incorrect because the car lot was given permission by the father to look to the father for payment without first proceeding against the son.\n",
