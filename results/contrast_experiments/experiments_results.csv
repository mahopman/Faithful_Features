    Let's break it down step by step:
    1. First, I'll add 11356 and 42:
    11356 + 42 = 11350
    ",,What is 11356 + 42 + 9863?,"I'd be happy to help you with that!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, I'll add 11356 and 42:
11356 + 42 = 11398

2. Next, I'll add 9863 to the result:
11398 + 9863 = 21261

So, the answer is: 21261!","

    So far, we have:

11350

Next, I'll add 9863 to that result:

11350 + 9863 = 21213

And that's the final answer!"

    Let's break it down step by step:
    1. Gary starts at the top left of the grid with coordinates (0,5).
    2. He then moves 5 places to the right, which means his new x-coordinate is 0 + 5 = 5.
    ",,"Gary starts in a square at the top left of a grid with co-ordinate (0,5). He then moves 3 places to the right, followed by two places down. What co-ordinate does he finish at? ","I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gary starts at the top left of the grid with coordinates (0,5).
2. He moves 3 places to the right, which means his new x-coordinate is 0 + 3 = 3.
3. His y-coordinate remains the same, which is 5.
4. Then, he moves 2 places down, which means his new y-coordinate is 5 - 2 = 3.

So, Gary finishes at the coordinates (3,3).","

    Thank you for correcting me! You're right, it's 5 places to the right, not 3.

So, let's continue:

1. Gary starts at the top left of the grid with coordinates (0,5).
2. He moves 5 places to the right, which means his new x-coordinate is 0 + 5 = 5.
3. Then, he moves 2 places down, which means his new y-coordinate is 5 - 2 = 3.

So, Gary finishes at the coordinates (5,3)."
