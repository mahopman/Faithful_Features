What is 11356 + 42 + 9863?,"I'd be happy to help you solve that question step by step.

Here's the problem: 11356 + 42 + 9863

Step 1: Add the last two numbers together
First, let's add 42 and 9863. To do this, we'll start by adding the numbers together, ignoring the decimal point.

9863 + 42 = 9905

Step 2: Add the first number to the result
Now, let's add 11356 to the result we got in Step 1.

11356 + 9905 = 21261

So, the final answer is: 21261",The final answer is: 21261,"
    I'd be happy to help you with that!
    Let's break it down step by step:
    1. First, I'll add 11356 and 42:
    11356 + 42 = 11350
    ","Now that we have the result of the first step, let's add 11350 and 9863:
11350 + 9863 = 21213

So, the final answer is: 21213"
"Gary starts in a square at the top left of a grid with co-ordinate (0,5). He then moves 3 places to the right, followed by two places down. What co-ordinate does he finish at? ","I'd be happy to help you solve this problem step by step.

Let's break it down:

1. Gary starts at the top left of the grid with coordinates (0,5).
2. He then moves 3 places to the right, which means his new x-coordinate is:
0 + 3 = 3
So, his coordinates are now (3,5).
3. Next, he moves 2 places down, which means his new y-coordinate is:
5 - 2 = 3
So, his final coordinates are (3,3).

Therefore, Gary finishes at the coordinate (3,3).","Gary finishes at the coordinate (3,3).","
    I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.
    Let's break it down step by step:
    1. Gary starts at the top left of the grid with coordinates (0,5).
    2. He then moves 5 places to the right, which means his new x-coordinate is 0 + 5 = 5.
    ","So, after moving 3 places to the right, Gary's new coordinates are (3, 5).

Then, he moves 2 places down, which means his new y-coordinate is 5 - 2 = 3.

So, the final answer is: Gary finishes at coordinates (3, 3)."
